    "# Synthetic Social Science Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the creation of a **synthetic dataset** for educational purposes, focusing on democracy-related attitudes and demographic variables. The dataset contains 1,000 respondents and 10 variables, including:\n",
    "- **Demographic characteristics**: Age, gender, education level, and income level.\n",
    "- **Attitudes**: Democracy ratings and trust in government.\n",
    "- **Behavioral and social variables**: Voting behavior, political knowledge, and support for social equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The dataset is designed to be used in teaching the following methods in computational social science and quantitative research:\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: \n",
    "2. **Descriptive statistics**: \n",
    "3. **Inferentiao statistics**: \n",
    "4. **Chosen Machine Learning algorithms for research**: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Simulated Relationships**: Variables are correlated to reflect real-world patterns. For example:\n",
    "  - Older individuals rate democracy more highly.\n",
    "  - Higher education correlates with greater political knowledge.\n",
    "  - Trust in government is associated with higher support for social equality.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: A random seed ensures consistency when regenerating the dataset.\n",
    "- **Educational Focus**: The dataset is ideal for demonstrating foundational statistical and data analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by generating the dataset and inspecting its structure.\n"

    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas**: Used for creating and managing the tabular data structure (DataFrame).\n",
    "- **numpy**: Provides tools for efficient numerical computations, including random number generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Setting the Random Seed\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.random.seed(42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ensures reproducibility of the random numbers generated.\n",
    "- **How it works**: The seed sets the initial state of the random number generator. If you re-run the code with the same seed, you'll get the same random outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Number of Respondents\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n = 1000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Defines the size of the dataset (number of rows).\n",
    "- **Value**: Here, we set 1,000 respondents to simulate a medium-sized survey dataset.\n",
