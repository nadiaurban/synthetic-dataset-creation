# Synthetic Social Science Dataset Creation

## Overview

This repository contains resources for creating a **synthetic dataset** focused on **democracy-related attitudes** and **demographic variables**. The dataset is designed for educational purposes, enabling students and researchers to practice data analysis techniques commonly used in **Computational Social Science**.

### Purpose

The synthetic dataset consists of 1,000 respondents and 10 variables, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Education Level, Income Level
- **Attitudes**: Democracy Rating, Trust in Government
- **Behavioral Variables**: Voting Behavior, Political Knowledge, Social Equality Support

It is ideal for practicing:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**

### Key Features
- **Simulated Relationships**: Variables are correlated to reflect real-world patterns (e.g., age and democracy rating, education and political knowledge).
- **Reproducibility**: A random seed ensures consistent results when regenerating the dataset.

### Repository Files
- **Survey Perspectives on Democracy and Social Issues.docx**: The survey used for dataset creation.
- **Synthetic_Democracy_Dataset.csv**: The generated synthetic dataset.
- **Synthetic_Democracy_Survey_Codebook.docx**: Codebook explaining the dataset variables.
- **synthetic_dataset_creation.ipynb**: Python notebook with the code used to create the dataset.
